Unfortunately, none of the components are user-replaceable, so you need to get the configuration that best suits your needs upfront.",9.0,"The Apple MacBook Pro M3 is excellent for business use. This well-built laptop is easy to carry, and its battery lasts over 15 hours of light use, so you can go almost two days without plugging it in. It has a sharp, bright display, a comfortable keyboard, and a large, responsive touchpad. You get an excellent 1080p webcam for video calls and a fingerprint sensor to log in quickly. Its M3 SoCs can easily handle productivity tasks like web browsing, text processing, spreadsheets, and presentations. You can even make graphics and edit videos for your business. Unfortunately, none of the components are user-replaceable, and there's no USB-A port, so you'll need an adapter for your wired peripherals or dongles.",8.5,"The Apple MacBook Pro 14 (M3, 2023) is a premium workstation laptop. It replaces the Apple MacBook Pro 14 (M2, 2023) from early 2023. In addition to the Pro and Max SoC configurations, this new model is available with a base M3 chip, similar to the discontinued 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.

The port selection remains the same as its predecessor on the Pro and Max models; however, the base M3 model has one fewer USB-C and only supports Thunderbolt 3."
HP Pavilion Aero 13 (2024),"The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is very good for students. It's small and easy to carry around to classes, and its battery lasts all day on a single charge if you are doing tasks like note-taking or web browsing. The keyboard is great to use and takes no time to get used to, and its microphone does a great job picking up your voice. Unfortunately, the finish scratches easily from regular use. The webcam also isn't great as its image is overexposed; you may look unnatural in online classes. Finally, while the Ryzen 7 8840HS can perform some intensive tasks like programming, other configurations of this laptop aren't the best choice for students with demanding workflows.",7.9,"The HP Pavilion Aero 13 isn't ideal for gaming. Though the integrated AMD Radeon Graphics can handle older titles or puzzle games, it lacks the graphical horsepower for a smooth experience in modern AAA games. The screen only has a 60Hz refresh rate and doesn't have VRR to help with screen tearing. On the bright side, it stays cool and quiet under load; you can comfortably use the keyboard if you decide to play games.",6.6,"The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is decent for multimedia use. Its screen gets bright enough for use in all indoor and most outdoor environments, but it may still struggle outside in direct sunlight. Reflections from lamps or the sun also aren't a big deal inside. Its speakers sound clear and get quite loud, although, like most laptops, they lack the necessary bass to provide a full sound. Given its compact 13-inch chassis, this laptop is a great choice for watching content on the go, like traveling on the bus or a plane. Moreover, with over eight hours of battery life for video playback, you can easily watch a few movies or binge your favorite shows.",7.3,"Despite scoring well, the HP Pavilion Aero 13 isn't a workstation laptop. The Ryzen 5 and 7 CPUs are low to moderate-power CPUs designed for thin and light chassis rather than workstations. There aren't options for dedicated GPUs, either. Also, you can only get this laptop with 16GB of soldered RAM. You can do some light color correction work as the display offers full sRGB coverage.",8.2,"The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good laptop for business use. Its small, 13-inch chassis makes it easy to carry around to meetings and while you travel. It offers great performance for general productivity tasks like spreadsheets and word processing, and some CPU options can handle more intensive ones like programming. Its keyboard and touchpad are also easy to adapt to and comfortable to use; know that the touchpad isn't perfect, as it struggles to maintain continuous inputs like dragging items across your desktop. Battery life is great at over 10 hours of light use on a single charge. The main issues revolve around the build quality and webcam. The finish is prone to scratching from everyday use; this may not present well when meeting clients. Finally, the webcam image is drastically overexposed, making you look unnatural. It's disappointing since HP has included a 1440p webcam.",7.7,"The HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a mid-rangeÂ ultraportable laptop. ThisÂ 13-bg000Â series from 2024 is available with AMD 8040-series Ryzen 5 or 7 CPUs, integrated AMD Radeon Graphics, 16GB of LP-DDR5x RAM, and up to a 1TB NVMe SSD. The storage is user-replaceable.

As for the display, it has an OLED panel with a high refresh rate and decent response time, but it doesn't support FreeSync or G-SYNC to reduce screen tearing.",7.1,"The HP Spectre x360 14 (2024) is excellent for media consumption. It's very portable, thanks to its thin and light design, and since it's a 2-in-1 convertible, you can set it in tent mode or use it as a tablet. Its OLED display looks incredibly sharp and colorful, producing deep, inky blacks, making it fantastic for dark room viewing and HDR content. The only downside with the display is that its glossy finish struggles with bright reflections, so visibility can be an issue in well-lit environments. The speakers get very loud with minimal compression, and they sound clear and full, albeit light on bass. Its battery life is outstanding at over nine hours of video playback, giving you ample time to get through multiple movies and TV show episodes.",8.6,"The HP Spectre x360 14 (2024) isn't designed for use as a workstation. It provides a great user experience overall; however, its low-power CPU and integrated GPU can't handle highly demanding workloads. Also, you can only get up to 32GB of soldered RAM. You can do some color-correction work, though, as its 2.8k OLED display has full DCI P3 and near-full Adobe RGB coverage.

It's lightweight and easy to carry around, so you can easily watch videos while roaming around your home. Its high-resolution screen is vibrant and bright, though it isn't the best for dark room viewing, as its low contrast makes blacks look gray.

For light use, like taking notes or doing research, the battery can last the full school day on a single charge. While it provides a good user experience overall, its touch and keyboard layout definitely require an adjustment period. This laptop features a number of bright displays with a 16:10 aspect ratio, giving you more vertical space for reading articles. Finally, despite its higher-end hardware, this laptop is only suitable for general productivity tasks; its cooling really limits its performance, so people wanting a laptop for 3D modeling or video editing should look elsewhere.",8.0,"The Dell XPS 13 (2024) isn't designed for gaming. The only GPU option available is the integrated Intel Arc graphics on the Intel Meteor Lake CPUs. This means it can handle some puzzle games or turn-based strategy games at low settings at 1080p but lacks the graphical horsepower for anything more intensive. The IPS panel options have a slow response time; while most OLED panels have near instantaneous response times, this panel does not, as there's visible ghosting and poor motion clarity. None of the display options include variable refresh rate technologies, so screen tearing will be an issue. On a positive note, if you do use this laptop for gaming, it stays cool and quiet.",6.0,"The Dell XPS 13 (2024) is great for multimedia consumption.

Battery life is good, so you don't need to worry about keeping the laptop plugged in to enjoy your favorite shows, and the laptop is extremely portable, making it convenient to use for media playback on a bus or plane. The weak point is the laptop's speakers. Unlike the larger 14- or 16-inch models, which feature up-firing speakers, the 13-inch has down-firing speakers that rattle quite a bit as you increase the volume. They get loud, but the louder the volume, the more tinny and fatiguing they become.",8.4,"The Dell XPS 13 (2024) isn't designed as a workstation. While it features Intel's very capable Meteor Lake CPUs, the laptop's poor thermal solution limits performance for intensive workloads requiring sustained performance. The port selection is another place where the XPS 13 falls short for workstation needs. It only includes two USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports, so you will need an adapter for peripherals, Ethernet, etc. That being said, both its OLED and QHD+ IPS panel options offer complete coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, making them a great option for light color correction work. By contrast, the FHD+ panel only covers the sRGB color space.",7.4,"The Dell XPS 13 (2024) is a good business laptop.
